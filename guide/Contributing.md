# Contributing

Contributing helps us keep this Guide be as tidy and up-to-date as possible. All contributions are greatly appreciated.

We utilize [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org) to build the Guide. We also write our Guide in `MarkDown` files. If you want to contribute we highly recommend knowing the basics of these two.

## Getting started

```sh{2,4}:no-line-numbers
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
# Run vuepress in dev mode
pnpm dev
```
